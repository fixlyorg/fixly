## Update Title
Fix: CSS Not Rendering Properly After Initial Setup

## Summary
During the development process, the CSS styles were not being applied correctly after cloning and running the project.  
The issue was traced to incorrect handling of static files and stylesheet paths. This caused the application to render without the intended styles.

## Issue
- CSS was missing or not being displayed properly in the browser.  
- The layout appeared unstyled, unlike the original version.  

## Root Cause
- The stylesheet was either:
  - Not linked properly in the HTML template, or  
  - The server was not correctly serving static files.  

## Solution Implemented
1. Verified the correct relative path to the CSS file.  
2. Updated the project to ensure static assets (CSS files) are correctly served.  
3. Confirmed the styles are being applied consistently across all pages.  

## Outcome
- CSS now renders as expected.  
- The layout and design match the original version before the issue appeared.  

## Next Steps
- Regularly test static file rendering after pulling/cloning the repository.  
- Consider adding documentation for setting up the project environment to avoid similar issues in the future.
